# Lab 3: Git

1. Pick up your name tag.

2. Find your group. You can find your group number by visiting https://www.msyamkumar.com/cs320/s23/messages.html?topic=group. Ask your TA/peer mentor if you need help finding your group members. 

3. Get to know your group members, asking each other the following:

* Name + major
* What is your hometown, and what is your favorite place there?
* If you could create a silly law, what would it be?

4. Practice using the [Git Simulator](./git-sim).

5. Try [merging branches](./git-conflict) and conflict resolution.

6. Practice using shell commands for [memory / space management](./htop_df_ls).

7. Create a GitHub account and learn how to create a [pull request](./git-pr) to suggest changes to GitHub repos that you don't own. 

8. Return your name tag.

9. Practice on your own [visual complexity analysis](./big-o).

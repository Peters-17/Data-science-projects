# Lab 5

1. Pick up your name tag.

2. We have the detailed mortgage dataset we're using for P2 thanks to the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.  Discuss with your group: *if you could pass a law requiring the collection and release of a new dataset, what data would you choose?*  Feel free to answer based on what you think would be fun or interesting, or you can think about how your dataset might bring more transparency to a societal issue (like how the HDMA data makes it easier to monitor for discriminatory lending practices).

2. Inside your `cs320-s23-projects` repo, there is a notebook `cs320-s23-projects/labs/debug/4-self/main.ipynb`.  Open it and fix the bugs. 

3. Create a [binary search tree](./bst-groups) for use in P2.  Note: some of you like to do lab exercises before the scheduled lab time, but I don't recommend doing this part until we've covered BSTs in class.

4. Return your name tag.

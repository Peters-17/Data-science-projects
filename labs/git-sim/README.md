# Git Simulator

Let's start by practicing in the Git simulator <a

target="_blank">here</a>.  Try to run commands to get to the following state (if you get stuck, check the [solution here](solution.md)):

Useful commands for the above problem:
* `git commit`: make a new commit
* `git branch bname`: create a branch named `bname`
* `git checkout bname`: move `HEAD` to the commit referenced by the `bname`
* `git checkout c1`: move `HEAD` to the `c1` commit
* `git merge bname`: merge changes on the `bname` branch into the current branch
* `git branch -D bname`: delete the branch named `bname`

If you have some free time at the end of the lab, you can try out the following challenge. 

Try to get to this state (no answer to check for this one, so you'll need to work for it!):

**Hint:** Start by creating commits on four branches, b1, b2, b3, and b4.
Merge b2 into b1 and b4 into b3.  Then merge the two merge commits
with a third merge commit.

# Project 3 Grading Guidelines

You can find details about the grading process [here](https://github.com/msyamkumar/cs320-s23-projects/blob/main/p1/README.md). 

**reveal_secrets() function:**
* Hardcoding: -5 points 
    * e.g., directly inputting clue instead of generating it from the travellog dataframe
* time.sleep() is never used: -3 points 
* time.sleep() is used in the wrong place: -1 point (only deduct once for the entire reveal_secrets funcion)
